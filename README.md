## ðŸ¥ª About VS Tesco:
*Picture this,*
You're the walking internet dial up sounding guy popping to the local Tesco to get a meal deal and a new microphone as his old one broke when trying to microwave it.
Suddenly the self service machine decides it wants to rap battle it! How and why? You tell me!
